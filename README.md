# 🌌 Nostra Project

Welcome to the **Nostra Project** – a front-end web project created as part of my learning journey in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps me practice and reinforce concepts through hands-on implementation, focusing on UI design, responsiveness, and adding dynamic elements.

## 🚀 About the Project
